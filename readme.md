## Congressional Clusters: Analyzing Voting Patterns and Demographics in the 118th U.S. Congress

Description:

This project aims to update and extend previous analyses of Congressional demographics and behavior—such as FiveThirtyEight’s study on the aging of Congress—by incorporating current data from the 118th U.S. Congress. The project will compile and clean demographic information (e.g., age, gender, race, education, generation) for all current members of Congress, along with their most recent roll-call voting records.

Using these datasets, we will perform a cluster analysis to explore whether natural groupings emerge based on voting behavior and demographic attributes, and to what extent these clusters align with or diverge from official party affiliations. The goal is to uncover whether voting patterns and demographic profiles offer predictive or explanatory power beyond traditional partisan labels, and to identify outliers or evolving trends in Congressional alignment.

The final product will include reproducible code, and a written summary of insights that can contribute to public understanding of Congress’s internal dynamics in the post-Boomer era.

## Contents

- Project 1 will have an explanation of the sources of data, data dictionary and an explanation of how we preprocessed and cleaned the data
- Project 2 is an Exploratory data analysis of the data
- Project 3 is the actual cluster analysis, using one clustering technique
- Project 4 is a simulation study to compare 2 or more clustering techniques with generated data that has similar characteristics as the real data
- Final_Docs a folder containing all the work to produce the final presentation and the final report
